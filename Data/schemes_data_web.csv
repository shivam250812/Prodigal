Tagore National Fellowship for Cultural Research,"{'value': 1567, 'label': 'Ministry Of Culture'}",Individual,"
   1. Fellows who have sound academic or professional credentials and have made significant contributions to knowledge in their respective fields will be eligible to apply for Tagore National Fellowship.
   1. Preferably the Fellows who have 5 years of experience in conducting/guiding research or the same experience in performing/any other arts can apply for Tagore National Fellowship.
   1. The applicants must have an impressive list of publications into their credit, at least two monographs (single-authored).
   1. Fellows to be engaged must have both the credentials as laid down in the preceding paragraph, as well as a strong reputation in the field covered by the Nodal Institution.
   1. Those who have in the past directly engaged with major projects at the Nodal Institution and fulfilled the above-mentioned eligibility criteria for a Tagore Fellow are encouraged to apply for the Tagore National Fellowship.
   1. Once awarded a Tagore National Fellowship, a candidate cannot apply again for a Fellowship under this scheme, either at the same or any other institution covered under the Scheme.
   1. The Scheme will be open to both Indian and foreign nationals. However, the proportion of foreigners will not normally exceed one–third of the total fellowships awarded in a year.
**Note 01:** Interested Fellows are required to enclose a research proposal prepared on the guidelines provided in Appendix A.
**Note 02:** Fellows are also required to prepare a short write-up on how the proposed research would be beneficial for the respective nodal institution.
**Note 03:** The honour and the honorarium are both of a very high order; the Institution Level Search-cum-Screening Committee (ILSSC) of the sponsoring institution and the National Selection Committee may keep these in mind while recommending/ selecting the Tagore National Fellows.
**Note 04:** In short, a person selected for the Tagore National Fellowship should be one who has already become a ‘legend’ in his area of work or is regarded very highly. It is appropriate that those who do not come near this description may not apply or be considered for the highest honour and honorarium accorded to a Fellow in India under this Fellowship.
&gt; **Areas of Research and Eligible Projects:**
   1. The selected Fellows will normally work on a project that benefits the Nodal Institution in terms of unraveling its resources. The subject of research should be one that can be usefully pursued with the resources and facilities of the Nodal Institution awarding the Fellowship, though he/she will be free to draw on the resources and facilities of other institutions, as well.
   1. If the subject of research extends to more than one institution or the Fellow otherwise needs to draw upon the resources and facilities of other institution(s), the Nodal Institution awarding the Fellowship would recommend the Fellow to such other institution(s). In rare cases, where two institutions appear to be of almost equal importance to the Fellows, the second institution may be deemed to be the ‘Co-institution’ and the two may sign a Tripartite MoU regarding Intellectual Property, Publication, Credit sharing, facilities, etc. but accounting shall be with the Nodal Institution.
   1. Since the Scheme is focused on unraveling the cultural resources of the Nodal Institution, the project must be driven in that direction, that is, to use substantially the resources of the Nodal Institution. The inputs required for the project should have a very strong linkage with the resources available with the Nodal Institution and (in rare cases) the Co-institution.
   1. At the end of it, the project outcome must be beneficial for the Nodal Institution or co-institution, if any, and must add to the existing knowledge of the institution/subject. 
","The Scheme has been introduced to invigorate and revitalize the various institutions under the Ministry of Culture and other identified cultural institutions in the country, by encouraging Fellows/academicians to affiliate themselves with these institutions to work on projects of mutual interest.

**Note:** For Fellows selected under MoC Institutions, the expenditure in this regard will be borne by the concerned MoC Institution from the grant-in-aid received by them from their administrative Division of the Ministry.
&gt; **Accommodation:**
  - A Fellow who is not a bona-fide resident of the place of the Participating Institution to which he has proposed to be affiliated and who intends to take up rented accommodation in the city of the desired Institution will be required to indicate this fact at the time of applying for Fellowship.

Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana - Gramin,"{'value': 487, 'label': 'Ministry Of Rural Development'}",Family,"The universe of eligible beneficiaries under PMAY-G will include all the houseless households living in zero, one, or two-room houses with kutcha walls and kutcha roofs (as per SECC data, and subject to the exclusion process).
> **Criteria for Automatic/Compulsory Inclusion -** 
1.	Households without shelter
2.	Destitute/ living on alms
3.	Manual scavengers
4.	Primitive Tribal Groups
5.	Legally released bonded laborer
> **Prioritisation within the Universe**
i.  There will be multilayered prioritization within the universe of eligible PMAY-G beneficiaries. Priority will first be assigned on the basis of parameters reflecting housing deprivation in each category viz., SC/ST, Minorities, and Others. 
ii.  To begin with, households will be prioritized based on houselessness followed by the number of rooms; zero, one, and two rooms, in that order. 
iii.  In a particular social category viz., SC/ST, Minorities, and Others, households that are houseless or living in houses with a lower number of rooms shall not be ranked below households living in houses with a higher number of rooms.
Within the above priority groups, households that fulfill the criteria of &quot;compulsory inclusion&quot;, will be further elevated. Automatically included households shall not rank lower than other households within a priority group. Inter-se priority within the two subgroups viz. households which are automatically included and otherwise will be determined based on their cumulative deprivation scores. 
The scores will be calculated from the socio-economic parameters given below with each having equal weight:
i.	Households with no adult member between ages 16 to 59
ii.	Female-headed households with no adult male member between ages 16 to 59
iii.	Households with no literate adult above 25 years
iv.	Households with any disabled member and no able-bodied adult member
v.	Landless Households deriving the major part of their income from manual casual labor
vi. Households with higher deprivation scores will be ranked higher within the subgroups.
**Note:** _To ensure that assistance is targeted at those who are genuinely deprived and that the selection is objective and verifiable, the housing deprivation parameters in the SECC data will be used for identifying households and then verified by the Gram Sabhas._
> ***Earmarking of Targets -*** 
**For SC/ST:**
60% of the target allocated to each State/ UT should be earmarked for SC/STs, subject to the availability of eligible beneficiaries. Within earmarked targets, the proportion of SC and ST is to be decided from time to time by the respective States/UTs. Further, the States/ UTs would be allowed to interchange targets between SC and ST if there are no eligible beneficiaries from either of the category and it is certified as such. In case all eligible SC and ST households are covered, the State/ UT targets would be allocated to beneficiaries from the &#39;Other&#39; categories included in the Permanent Wait List drawn from SECC 2011.
**For Minorities:**
Further, as far as possible, 15% of the total fund would be earmarked for Minorities at the National Level for households. The allocation of targets for Minorities among the States/UTs will be on the basis of the proportionate rural population of Minorities in the respective State/UT as per Census 2011 data. Minorities notified under Section 2(c) of the National Commission for Minorities Act, 1992 are to be considered eligible for receiving benefits against Minority earmarks.
**For PwDs:**
Accordingly, in the scheme of PMAY-G, while deciding the inter-se priority among the beneficiaries who are to be provided assistance, households with any disabled member and no able-bodied adult member have been accorded additional deprivation score so that such households are given priority while allotting the houses. Keeping in view the provisions of the Persons with Disabilities Act, of 1995, the States to the extent possible, may ensure that 3% of beneficiaries at the State Level are from among persons with disabilities.
> **Tie Breaker**
In case there is a tie with more than one household within a subgroup having the same deprivation score, the households will be ranked according to priority on the basis of the following parameters:
i.	Households with widows and next-of-kin of members of defence/paramilitary/police forces killed in action.
ii.	Households where a member is suffering from leprosy or cancer and People living with HIV (PLHIV).
iii.	Households with a single girl child.
iv.	Beneficiary families of the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, commonly known as the Forest Rights Act.
v.	Transgender persons.

   1. The applicants must have an impressive list of publications into their credit, at least two monographs (single-authored).
   1. Fellows to be engaged must have both the credentials as laid down in the preceding paragraph, as well as a strong reputation in the field covered by the Nodal Institution.
   1. Those who have in the past directly engaged with major projects at the Nodal Institution and fulfilled the above-mentioned eligibility criteria for a Tagore Fellow are encouraged to apply for the Tagore National Fellowship.
   1. Once awarded a Tagore National Fellowship, a candidate cannot apply again for a Fellowship under this scheme, either at the same or any other institution covered under the Scheme.
   1. The Scheme will be open to both Indian and foreign nationals. However, the proportion of foreigners will not normally exceed one–third of the total fellowships awarded in a year.
**Note 01:** Interested Fellows are required to enclose a research proposal prepared on the guidelines provided in Appendix A.
**Note 02:** Fellows are also required to prepare a short write-up on how the proposed research would be beneficial for the respective nodal institution.
**Note 03:** The honour and the honorarium are both of a very high order; the Institution Level Search-cum-Screening Committee (ILSSC) of the sponsoring institution and the National Selection Committee may keep these in mind while recommending/ selecting the Tagore National Fellows.
**Note 04:** In short, a person selected for the Tagore National Fellowship should be one who has already become a ‘legend’ in his area of work or is regarded very highly.

&gt; **Areas of Research and Eligible Projects:**
   1. The selected Fellows will normally work on a project that benefits the Nodal Institution in terms of unraveling its resources. The subject of research should be one that can be usefully pursued with the resources and facilities of the Nodal Institution awarding the Fellowship, though he/she will be free to draw on the resources and facilities of other institutions, as well.
   1. If the subject of research extends to more than one institution or the Fellow otherwise needs to draw upon the resources and facilities of other institution(s), the Nodal Institution awarding the Fellowship would recommend the Fellow to such other institution(s). In rare cases, where two institutions appear to be of almost equal importance to the Fellows, the second institution may be deemed to be the ‘Co-institution’ and the two may sign a Tripartite MoU regarding Intellectual Property, Publication, Credit sharing, facilities, etc. but accounting shall be with the Nodal Institution.
   1. Since the Scheme is focused on unraveling the cultural resources of the Nodal Institution, the project must be driven in that direction, that is, to use substantially the resources of the Nodal Institution. The inputs required for the project should have a very strong linkage with the resources available with the Nodal Institution and (in rare cases) the Co-institution.
   1. At the end of it, the project outcome must be beneficial for the Nodal Institution or co-institution, if any, and must add to the existing knowledge of the institution/subject. 
","The Scheme has been introduced to invigorate and revitalize the various institutions under the Ministry of Culture and other identified cultural institutions in the country, by encouraging Fellows/academicians to affiliate themselves with these institutions to work on projects of mutual interest.

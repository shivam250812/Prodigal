performingany other arts can apply for tagore national fellowship. 1. the applicants must have an impressive list of publications into their credit at least two monographs singleauthored. 1. fellows to be engaged must have both the credentials as laid down in the preceding paragraph as well as a strong reputation in the field covered by the nodal institution. 1. those who have in the past

once awarded a tagore national fellowship a candidate cannot apply again for a fellowship under this scheme either at the same or any other institution covered under the scheme. 1. the scheme will be

enclose a research proposal prepared on the guidelines provided in appendix a.  fellows are also required to prepare a short writeup on how the proposed research would be beneficial for the respective nodal institution.  the honour and the honorarium are both of a very high order the institution level searchcumscreening committee ilssc of the sponsoring institution and the national selection committee may keep these in mind while recommending selecting the tagore national fellows.  in short a person selected for the tagore national fellowship should be one who has already become a legend in his area of work or is regarded very highly. it is appropriate that those who do not come near this description may not apply or be considered for the highest honour and honorarium accorded to a fellow in india under this fellowship.  areas of research and eligible projects 1. the selected fellows will normally work on a project that benefits the nodal institution in terms of unraveling its resources. the subject of research should be one that can be usefully pursued with the resources and facilities of the nodal institution awarding the fellowship though heshe will be free to draw on the resources and facilities of other institutions as well. 1. if the subject of research extends to more than one institution or the fellow otherwise needs to draw upon the resources and facilities of other institutions the nodal institution awarding the fellowship would recommend the fellow to such other institutions. in rare cases where two institutions appear to be of almost equal importance to the fellows the second institution may be deemed to be the coinstitution and the two may sign a tripartite mou regarding intellectual property publication credit sharing facilities etc. but accounting shall be with the nodal institution. 1. since the scheme is focused on unraveling the cultural resources of the nodal institution the project must be driven in that direction that is to use substantially the resources of the nodal institution. the inputs required for the project should have a very strong linkage with the resources available with the nodal institution and in rare cases the coinstitution. 1. at the end of it the project outcome must be beneficial for the nodal institution or coinstitution if any and must add to the existing knowledge of the institutionsubject.,the scheme has been introduced to invigorate and revitalize the various institutions under the ministry of culture and other identified cultural institutions in the country by encouraging fellowsacademicians to affiliate themselves with these institutions to work on projects of mutual interest.  honorarium 1. a tagore national fellow who is from a university college research institute or government setup in india would be entitled to the same pay including grade pay etc. which heshe would have drawn had heshe continued in hisher parent organization. essential or mandatory

abroad or from a setup other than university college research institute or government service or who has retired from active service andor is on pension would be entitled to a fixed honorarium of
